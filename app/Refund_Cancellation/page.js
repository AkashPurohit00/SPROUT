              <p>We value our customers and are committed to providing best services. Our clients need to realize that we do not offer a 100% guarantee on our Reports and hence cannot offer any refund on subscriptions regardless of the individual client’s performance. Once a service has been subscribed to and a payment has been made for the same, it can’t be cancelled or refunded in any case. If for some unforeseen reason, the client is not satisfied with our services, they may write us to seek direction. We will give our best effort to increase the satisfaction levels in such cases.</p>

                    <li>If the different subscription access is wrongfully delivered (different subscription instead of the subscription mentioned in the order confirmation) then we are open to extending full refund. If the client intimates this within 30 days of date of subscription, we will process the refund within 15 days of such intimation</li>
